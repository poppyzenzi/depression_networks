'I felt miserable or unhappy 
I didnâ€™t enjoy anything at all 
I felt so tired I just sat around and did nothing 
I was very restless
 I felt I was no good any more 
 I cried a lot 
I found it hard to think properly and concentrate 
 I hated myself 
 I was a bad person 
I felt lonely
I thought nobody really loved me 
I thought I could never be as good as other kids 
I did everything wrong'
